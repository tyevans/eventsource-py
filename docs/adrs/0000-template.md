## Context

<!--
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
Include relevant background, constraints, and forces at play.

## Decision

<!--
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

State the decision clearly and concisely. Use active voice:

- "We will not..."
- "We will implement..."

Include enough detail that someone could understand and implement the decision,
but keep it focused on the "what" rather than the "how" (implementation details
belong in code or separate documentation).
