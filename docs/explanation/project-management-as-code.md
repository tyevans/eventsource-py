# Project Management as Code (PMaC)

eventsource-py uses SpecOps to version-lock all project specifications directly in git.

## Why Specification as Code?
1. **Zero Context Drift**: Specifications, user stories, and tasks live in the exact same git commit history as implementation code.
2. **Thin Vertical Slicing**: Features are built through single-pass vertical slices rather than speculative horizontal layers.
3. **Hard Invariants**: Source files remain strictly under 500 lines to prevent monolithic file rot.
